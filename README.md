# Document_QA_OpenAI
A project to answer questions using OpenAi and ChainLit

First thing we need to add is ApiKey generated in openai.com


To run the program, we need to use the command `chainlit run document_qa.py -w` in the console and on localhost:8000.
After running the script, a chainlit.md file will be created and we will be able to change the first information appearing on localhost:8000 in it
